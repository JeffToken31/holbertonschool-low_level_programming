### [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)
Write a program that prints the last digit of a number.

### [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.

### [3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c)
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase and uppercase.

### [4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)
Write a program that prints the alphabet except the letters `q` and `e`.

### [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)
Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.

### [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)
Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 using `putchar`.

### [7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)
Write a program that prints the alphabet in reverse order.

Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

### [101-print_comb4.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c)
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

### [102-print_comb5.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c)
Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
