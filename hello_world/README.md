## Introduction to the basics of C programming, starting with preprocessor, compiler, and simple C programs.

### [0-preprocessor](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/0-preprocessor)
Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor.

### [1-compiler](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/1-compiler)
Write a script that compiles a C file to generate an object file.

### [2-assembler](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/2-assembler)
Write a script that generates the assembly code from a C file.

### [3-name](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/3-name)
Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable file.

### [4-puts.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/4-puts.c)
Write a C program that prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle".

### [5-printf.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/5-printf.c)
Write a C program that prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art".

### [6-size.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/6-size.c)
Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

### [100-intel](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/100-intel)
Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C file with Intel syntax.

### [101-quote.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/101-quote.c)
