# Function Pointers

## Working with function pointers in C.

### [0-print_name.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/function_pointers/0-print_name.c)
Write a function that prints a name.

### [1-array_iterator.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/function_pointers/1-array_iterator.c)
Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

### [2-int_index.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/function_pointers/2-int_index.c)
Write a function that searches for an integer.

### [3-calc.h](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/function_pointers/3-calc.h)
Header file for the operation functions.

### [3-get_op_func.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/function_pointers/3-get_op_func.c)
Write a function that selects the correct operation function to perform the operation asked by the user.

### [3-main.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/function_pointers/3-main.c)
Write a program that performs simple operations.

### [3-op_functions.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/function_pointers/3-op_functions.c)
Write the functions that perform basic arithmetic operations.

### [100-main_opcodes.c](https://github.com/JeffToken31/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/function_pointers/100-main_opcodes.c)
Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.
